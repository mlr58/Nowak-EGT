This file simulates the experiment on evolutionary game theory based on multiplayer prisoner's dilemma. This allows the simulation of said dynamics controlling the parametes $L=\sqrt{N}$ and $B$ (what defines the experiment's stability).

The output is meant to be a GIF representing the evolution of the system as a whole.
